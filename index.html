		<strong>How can Twitter users avoid falling for a scam?</strong><br>
Twitter users should ignore any direct messages or tweets that promise that by simply clicking on a
link they will receive thousands of followers. Any "get followers quick" links could be a way to steal
money or private information by installing malicious software onto your device or redirecting you to an
illegitimate website that may ask you for your personal or payment information.

		Social networking can keep us connected to family and friends and help us stay in touch with news in
real time. However, today’s cyber criminals can view social networking sites as rich and valuable sources
of personal data. Using crafty schemes, they can loot your private information piece by piece and gather
enough data to raid your identity and online accounts.

	<p class="lead">The holiday season and the New Year are a magical time—a time for thinking of others, a time for gathering with friends, and a time for taking stock of all the good things in life. In other words, it’s a perfect time for a fraudster to pounce while our guard is down, especially when shopping online.</p>

		<li><strong>Secure is the cure.</strong>  <br/>Learn how to tell if the site you are shopping is secure. Only shop sites that start with “https”. That “s” stands for “secure.” It means your personal data is protected.  There are other security clues, too, like a padlock icon next to the address.</li>
		<li><strong>Keep it personal.</strong>  <br/>Never send personal or financial information by email or to sites you don’t know and trust.</li>

			<p>Other tips for using Twitter and avoiding the pitfalls of a scam are:

		<li><strong>Inoculate to insulate.</strong>Keep anti-virus and anti-spyware software up to date. Never click a pop-up window or follow links in questionable emails. Create strong passwords.</li>
		<li><strong>Free, but at a price. </strong>Free trials are rarely free. Understand all terms and conditions. Note and understand suspicious pre-checked boxes before you order online.</li>

		When Ben Franklin famously wrote, <i>"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,"</i> I'm pretty sure he wasn't warning his readers about the perils of cyber crime. But in today's world of phishing, shoulder-surfing and computer spyware, his advice hits home.

		These alerts are triggered when the transaction meets certain criteria you select; for example, purchases over a certain dollar amount. In addition, banks generally will contact you if they spot unusual activity, such as multiple large purchases made within a short time frame or from different geographic areas.

	<p class="lead">Their names may sound funny but their financial consequences are not: "Phishing," "smishing" and "vishing" are just a few of the ways criminals can gain access to your financial or personal information via your computer or smartphone. </p>

			<p><strong>Email phishing:</strong>  <br/>This is where you receive an email, purportedly from a trusted source, that asks you to supply or confirm account information, log-in IDs or passwords. These imposters are attempting to trick you into divulging your information, often by trying to create a sense of urgency and panic; for example, saying your account will be frozen if you don't respond. </p>
	</div>
	
		<div class="block left ">
			<p><strong>SMiShing </strong><i>(for "Short Message Service" phishing):</i><br>Like phishing, only it uses text messages sent to your cell phone. Even if you don't click on any links or share information, just by responding you're verifying that your phone number is valid, which means it could be sold to others who will try to trick you into their own scams. 

</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>
		Don’t make a scammer’s vish come true. Learn how vishing works and what to do any time a caller asks you for personal data such as social security numbers, dates of birth, credit card numbers, and more. Never give personal information to someone who calls you. company will never ask for your personal information, though we may call you to report suspicious activity on your account. Get an incident number, and then call back the number on your credit card, not the number the caller gives you. A few simple rules are all you need to beat vishing.

indicate that the transmission is secure.
